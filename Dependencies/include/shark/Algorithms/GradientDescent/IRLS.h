///\brief Iterated Reweightes Least Squares iteratively calculates a newton step and then performs a line search in that direction
///
///IRLS tries to iteratively approximate the function as a quadratic function. Than it simply 
///performs a newton step to calculate the optimal solution to the quadratic problem. Since the 
///function itself is not quadratic most of the time, IRLS then performs a line search in that 
///direction instead of just taking the newton solution as optimal point. This prevents divergence.
///Be warned that calculating the inverse hessian takes O(n^2) 
/// memory tand O(n^3) runtime. So for large scale problems
///use CG or BFGS instead.
