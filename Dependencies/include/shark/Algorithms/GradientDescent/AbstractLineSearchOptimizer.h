/// Line Search optimizer find an iterative optimum by starting from some point, choosing a search direction and than
/// performing a line search in that direction. To choose the search direction a local model of the function is  often used.
/// This class is a base class for all line search method which implement the general behaviour of line search methods.
/// Derived classes only need to implement initModel() and computeSearchDirection() to initializee and update
/// the model and find a new line search direction. The remaining functionality is implemented by the optimizer.
///
/// Also derived classes should specialise read() and write() methods for serialization if they have additional members
/// as well as choose a name() for the optimizer.

	/// Line Search Methods use a Model to search for the next search direction.
	/// The model is initialized during init()
	virtual void initModel() = 0;

	/// \brief Updates the Model and computes the next search direction
	///
	/// After a step was performed, this method is called to compute the next 
	/// search direction. This usually involves updating the internal model using the 
	/// new and old step information. Afterwards m_searchDirection should contain
	/// the next search direction.
