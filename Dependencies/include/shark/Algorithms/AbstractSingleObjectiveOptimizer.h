	///\brief Base class for all single objective optimizer
	///
	///This class is a spezialization of the AbstractOptimizer itnerface for the class of single objective optimizers. A single objective optimizer is an optimizer
	///which can only optimize functions with a single objective. This is the default case for most optimisation problems. 
	///the class requires the ObjectiveFunction to provide a feasible starting point. If this is not possible, a second version of init is provided where the starting point can be 
	///explicitely defined. 
	///The Return type of an SingleObjectiveOptimizer is the SingleObjectiveResultSet which is a struct returning the best value of the function and together with it's point.
